Welcome to the Weather App project, a Python-based application designed to provide real-time weather updates. This app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the temperature, weather conditions, and an emoji that corresponds to the current weather. The application is built using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface and includes an animation of moving white balls, adding a dynamic touch to the user experience.

Key Features
Real-time Weather Updates: Fetches weather data for any city, including temperature (in Fahrenheit) and weather descriptions.
Weather Emojis: Displays an emoji that corresponds to the current weather conditions.
Interactive User Interface: Built using PyQt5 with a user-friendly input for city name.
Animation: Enjoy an engaging visual effect with floating white balls animated around the screen.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for app development.
PyQt5: A toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data.
Git & GitHub: Version control and project management, ensuring organized and trackable changes throughout the development process.
Installation & Setup
To run this application locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyQt5 (pip install PyQt5)
requests module (pip install requests)
Steps to Run the App
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Dagimawi7/Weather-App-py.git](https://github.com/Dagimawi7/Weather-Application.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Weather-App-py
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python weather.py
Enter the name of a city to get real-time weather information.

Usage
Open the app and type the name of a city into the input box.
Click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve the weather details.
The temperature, weather description, and a corresponding weather emoji will be displayed.
Enjoy the animated visual of white balls floating around the window as you interact with the app.
Git & GitHub Usage
Throughout the development of this project, I used Git for version control to ensure that all changes were tracked and organized. The project was developed using the following practices:

Commit Messages: I wrote clear and concise commit messages to describe each change made to the project, allowing easy traceability of progress and bug fixes.
Branches: I used branches for feature development, ensuring that the main branch always contained a stable version of the app.
Pull Requests: I used pull requests to merge features and improvements, maintaining a clean and well-organized project.

Future Enhancements
While the app is fully functional, there are several areas for improvement and future development, including:

Adding additional weather details such as wind speed and humidity.
Allowing users to search for weather updates by city name or zip code.
Improving the design with animations for transitions and weather updates.
Conclusion
This Weather App showcases my skills in Python, PyQt5, and API integration, with a focus on building a functional, interactive, and visually engaging application. The use of Git and GitHub demonstrates my ability to manage and version control a project in a collaborative and professional manner.
